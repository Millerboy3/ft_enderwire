# ft_enderwire
This is the FizzysTech take on the Enderwire conversion

This conversion is a modified version of DaRk_dOg's (boubounokefalos) conversion with a number of updates we all think should be made to the Switchwire.

We have incorporated the Nevermore V4 filter into the design and other changes from the stock design will be added in due time.

Initial upload of the FT Viperwire conversion. Since there is no CAD file for the Anycubic Vyper frame, we have created it from scratch as per inputs from Robert on Discord.

All files in the SLTs folder are what what have been modified from DaRk_dOg's Enderwire conversion.

SLT's for the modified files have been uploaded for those that would like to test fit. Regular updates are being made as we progress testing the updated parts we push out.
