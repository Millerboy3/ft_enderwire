# Longer Bed Screws
This is a mod for the stock printed bed screws on the enderwire mod when using the Zbolt Z endstop and/or the nozzle brush mod with a stock ender bed.   

I used the silicone stock spring replacements that caused it to be hard to adjust the bed knobs and install them.  This requires 4x M4 nuts to be installed and used inside just like the normal bed screw mods.


A Second Version with larger bed screws will be added.
